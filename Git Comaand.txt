git --version // to show the version of your Git (I highly encourage you to download and install the latest version )

git config --global user.name "your name "  // to config your name 

git config --global user.email  zakariabouregbidev  // to change your email configuration 

git config --global -e // it open your default editor to edit all the configuration  

git config --global core.autocrlf true // If you’re programming on Windows and working with people who are not (or vice-versa), you’ll probably run into line-ending issues at some point,This is because Windows uses both a carriage-return character and a linefeed character for newlines in its files

git config --global core.autocrlf input // If you’re on a Linux or macOS system that uses LF line endings, then you don’t want Git to automatically convert them when you check out files; however, if a file with CRLF endings accidentally gets introduced, then you may want Git to fix it. You can tell Git to convert CRLF to LF on commit but not the other way around by setting core.autocrlf to input:

git config --help // to show you all the command of git 

git init  // to initialize an empty git repo

ls // to list all the file in the folder 

rm -rf .git // to remove the init git repo

git status // to see the status of the working directory on the staging area 

git add . // to add all the files to the staging area 

git add *.txt // to add all the files that ends with .txt  to the staging area 

git add filename  // to add the specific file to the staging area  

git commit -m "initial command"  // to commitin the changes made 

git rm "file name"  // to remove a file  from both workin directory and staging area

git rm --cached -r file name // to remaove the file just from the staging area 

git mv file1 file2 // rename file1 to file2

git diff --staged // to see what we have in the staging area that is going to be committed

git status -s //  to see short status instead of long status that is maybe very wordy

git log // to see all the history of what we commit so far 

git show "the selected identify"  // to see the content of a specific commit 

git restore --staged "namefile" // to unstaging the specific file
